## Highlights

- **Single-binary payload** for PS4 (Orbis) and PS5 (Prospero), plus a Linux/macOS host build for offline development.
- **Native desktop frontend** in C++17 with Dear ImGui, OpenGL, and GLFW — packaged as `.app` on macOS, `.exe` on Windows, and a `.desktop` entry on Linux.
- **Capability-aware protocol** — the frontend adapts gracefully to older or partial payloads without crashing.
- **Five scanner modes**: exact value, process-wide exact, process-wide AOB, pointer chain, unknown initial value, plus a heuristic **Smart Auto-Search** engine tuned for common game values (health, ammo, resources).
- **Non-blocking UI** — connect, scan, and telemetry requests run on worker threads and stream results back via `std::future` polling.
- **Repository-backed localization** — English is embedded, while additional languages are listed, downloaded, validated, and cached from the project repository.
- **Embeddable library target** (`libmemdbg.a`) for integrating the payload core into other tools.
- **Zero-config discovery** — payloads respond to UDP broadcasts so the frontend can auto-populate the console list without hardcoding a debug port.
- **Crash-resilient logging** — ring-buffered event log with signal-safe crash handlers; survives `SIGSEGV`/`SIGABRT`/`SIGFPE`/`SIGILL` and flushes to disk immediately. Captures frontend status, notifications, and UDP console logs.
- **DPI-aware UI** — auto-detects monitor content scale on startup and scales every widget, font, and layout proportionally for HiDPI / Retina displays.

```

The payload binds a TCP debug port and exposes process enumeration, map inspection, and memory primitives; it streams runtime logs over UDP. The frontend connects to the TCP endpoint, subscribes to telemetry, and renders the full interactive interface. Payloads advertise their capabilities via a bitmap in the `HELLO` response, so the frontend can hide unsupported features rather than erroring.

<br/>

## Features

### Scanner engine (payload-side)

- **Exact value scan** with type selection: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `f32`, `f64`, raw bytes, pointer.
- **Process-wide exact scan** with protection-mask and address-range filtering.
- **Process-wide AOB scan** with wildcard bytes (`??`) in cheat-engine signature style.
- **Range AOB scan** for targeted byte-pattern searches.
- **Pointer scan** with configurable max depth, alignment, and alignment-aware dereference.
- **Unknown initial value scan** — snapshots every aligned value as a baseline for later refinement.
- **Resilient I/O** — scans continue past faulting pages, accumulate `read_errors`, and carry pending bytes across 1 MiB chunk boundaries so cross-chunk matches are never lost.

### Frontend screens

| Screen | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Home (Command Center)** | Dashboard tiles for every workflow; live session and UDP status; recent map/hit/cheat chips. |
| **Consoles** | Direct payload session management: connect, disconnect, ping, shutdown, and start/stop the UDP log listener from one place. |
| **Processes** | Refresh the process list (PID / name / Title ID / Content ID / path), inspect memory maps, filter by protection flags, hide system maps, set a minimum-size and dump cap, dump selected or filtered maps to disk, run a basic process analysis. |
| **Memory** | Address-range read/write with a hex view; byte-patch input; watchpoints (polling) with overlay marks; allocation tracking with importable event streams and double-free detection; **Exploit Lab** with ROP gadget finder and heap-spray entropy analyzer. |
| **Scanner** | Exact-value scan, process-wide scan, unknown initial value scan, refinement pipeline (changed / unchanged / increased / decreased), and **Smart Auto-Search** with target presets (Health / Ammo / Resources) and a scored candidate list. |
| **Pointer Scan** | Trace pointer chains back from a target address with adjustable depth and alignment. |
| **AOB Scan** | `48 8B ?? ??`-style pattern search with wildcards, process-wide or range mode, and per-map protection filtering. |
| **Trainer** | Build cheats (name, address, type, ON/OFF/lock); import batchcodes (`offset`, `value`, `size`, AOB tokens); capture OFF values from live memory; set per-entry lock intervals; save and load `.cht`-style trainer files. |
| **Logs** | Live UDP telemetry feed with start / stop / clear / copy; sender endpoint; bind-retry counter; received / dropped / evicted message stats. |
| **Telemetry** | Payload runtime metrics (requires `PERF_TELEMETRY` capability): uptime, active connections, thread-pool size, total read/write bytes and call counts, throughput, scan-map LRU cache hit/miss rate, last-poll age. |
| **Settings** | Persistent connection defaults (host, TCP debug port, UDP log port, dump directory), 8-language picker — written to the per-platform app config directory. |
| **Credits** | Creator info, GitHub avatar and handle loaded at runtime, license, donation and repository links. |

### Frontend ergonomics

- Global hotkeys: **F1** Home · **F5** Connect/Disconnect · **F6** Processes · **F7** Scanner · **F8** Memory · **F9** Trainer · **F10** Logs.
- Toast notifications with auto fade-out and manual dismiss.
- Sidebar grouped into **Main / Tools / Observe / System** sections.
- Top bar with live chips for session state, loaded maps, scan hits, and active cheats.
- Status bar showing FPS, session state, target PID, and UDP listener stats.
- File picker for dump directory and trainer file save/load.
- Embedded logo, native window icon (`.icns` macOS · `.ico` Windows · `.desktop` Linux), and a `ResizeToFit`-friendly layout that handles live window resize.
- Full Unicode font stack: base Latin + Cyrillic ranges in the primary font, with OS-specific CJK fallback chains (Apple SD Gothic Neo / Hiragino Sans GB on macOS, Malgun Gothic / Arial Unicode MS on Windows) for Japanese, Korean, and Chinese glyphs.
- DPI-aware rendering — monitor content scale is auto-detected via GLFW; all sizes, fonts, spacings, and rounding radii scale proportionally for crisp rendering on HiDPI displays.

<br/>

## Wire Protocol

A compact binary protocol (`MEMDBG_PACKET_MAGIC = "MDBG"`, little-endian, version 1). All multi-byte fields are packed. Payloads declare capabilities via the `HELLO` response bitmap, so the frontend stays forward-compatible with older or platform-specific builds.

### Limits

| Constraint | Value |
|---|---|
| Max packet size | 1 MiB |
| Max `MEMORY_READ` size | 1 MiB |
| `BATCH_READ` / `BATCH_WRITE` items per call | 64 |
| Max scan value payload | 16 bytes |
| Optional result compression | LZ4 (advertised via `MEMDBG_CAP_LZ4`) |

### Commands

| Code | Command | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `0x0001` | `HELLO` | Capability bitmap, platform ID, version, debug/UDP ports. |
| `0x0002` | `PING` | Liveness probe. |
| `0x0100` | `PROCESS_LIST` | Enumerate all PIDs. |
| `0x0101` | `PROCESS_MAPS` | Memory map list for a PID. |
| `0x0102` | `PROCESS_INFO` | Name, executable path, Title ID, Content ID. |
| `0x0103` | `FOREGROUND_APP` | Metadata for the currently focused application. |
| `0x0104` / `0x0105` | `PROCESS_STOP` / `PROCESS_CONTINUE` | Suspend / resume a target process. |
| `0x0200` / `0x0201` | `MEMORY_READ` / `MEMORY_WRITE` | Single-address I/O. |
| `0x0202` / `0x0203` | `BATCH_READ` / `BATCH_WRITE` | Multi-address I/O in one round-trip (used by Auto-Search and trainer lock writes). |
| `0x0300` / `0x0301` | `SCAN_EXACT` / `SCAN_PROCESS_EXACT` | Value scan, range or process-wide. |
| `0x0302` / `0x0305` | `SCAN_AOB` / `SCAN_PROCESS_AOB` | Byte-pattern scan, range or process-wide. |
| `0x0303` | `SCAN_POINTER` | Pointer-chain search. |
| `0x0304` | `SCAN_UNKNOWN` | Baseline every aligned value for later refinement. |
| `0x0400` | `TELEMETRY` | Runtime performance metrics. |
| `0x0500` | `DISCOVERY` | UDP broadcast ping/pong for console auto-detection. |
| `0x7f00` | `SHUTDOWN` | Clean payload termination. |

Every `SCAN_*` response opens with a `memdbg_scan_response_prefix_t` carrying hit count, truncation flag, bytes scanned, elapsed time, and read/region/error counts — the same numbers the frontend surfaces on screen.

<br/>

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| PlayStation 5 | In development (`make payload-ps5`) |
| PlayStation 4 | In development (`make payload-ps4`) |
| Linux host | Supported |
| macOS host | Supported |
| Windows host + frontend | Supported |
| Frontend — Linux | Supported |
| Frontend — macOS | Supported (universal `.app` bundle) |
| Frontend — Windows | Supported (`.exe` + `.ico`) |

The frontend connects to the payload over TCP (default port `9020`). Telemetry and discovery use UDP (`9023` and `9022` respectively). The host build requires all three ports to be free at startup.

<br/>

## Localization

The UI is driven by JSON locale files in [`frontend/locales/`](frontend/locales). English (`en.json`) and `imgui.ini` are embedded at build time via `tools/embed_assets.py`; every other language is fetched from the repository through [`manifest.json`](frontend/locales/manifest.json), stored under the platform app data directory, validated, and preloaded on startup. When a cached language differs from the repository version or fails JSON validation, the frontend redownloads it before loading it into memory.

Adding a new language is as simple as dropping a `<code>.json` file, regenerating the manifest, and opening a PR — `make check-locales` will flag missing keys, stale manifest size/hash data, and format-string mismatches before the build ships.

| Code | Language | File |
|---|---|---|
| `en` | English | [`en.json`](frontend/locales/en.json) |
| `es` | Español | [`es.json`](frontend/locales/es.json) |
| `it` | Italiano | [`it.json`](frontend/locales/it.json) |
| `fr` | Français | [`fr.json`](frontend/locales/fr.json) |
| `pt` | Português | [`pt.json`](frontend/locales/pt.json) |
| `de` | Deutsch | [`de.json`](frontend/locales/de.json) |
| `ja` | 日本語 | [`ja.json`](frontend/locales/ja.json) |
| `ru` | Русский | [`ru.json`](frontend/locales/ru.json) |

```sh
make check-locales   # fails if any locale is missing a key present in en.json
python3 tools/generate_locale_manifest.py
```

<br/>

## Building

### Prerequisites

| Component | Requirement |
|---|---|
| C toolchain | C11-compatible (`cc` / `clang` / `gcc`) |
| C++ toolchain | C++17 with CMake 3.24+, Ninja recommended |
| PS5 payload | [`external/ps5-payload-sdk/`](external/ps5-payload-sdk) (override with `PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK=`) |
| PS4 payload | [`external/ps4-payload-sdk/`](external/ps4-payload-sdk) (override with `PS4_PAYLOAD_SDK=`) |
| Frontend | OpenGL, GLFW, ImGui, nlohmann/json, stb — all pulled in via CMake `FetchContent` |

Both payload SDKs ship with the repository; no extra clones needed.

### Console payloads

```sh
# PS5
make payload-ps5
make deploy-ps5 PS5_HOST=192.168.1.100 PS5_PORT=9021

# PS4
make payload-ps4
make deploy-ps4 PS4_HOST=192.168.1.100 PS4_PORT=9021
```

### Embeddable static library

```sh
make payload-ps5-lib    # → build/ps5/libmemdbg.a
make payload-ps4-lib    # → build/ps4/libmemdbg.a
```

Both archives include the scanner, debug, telemetry, PAL, and privilege modules but omit the `main.c` entry point, so they link cleanly into a custom payload shell.

### Host validation build

```sh
make host
./build/MemDBG-host --bind=0.0.0.0 --debug-port=9020 \
                    --udp-port=9023 --data-root=/tmp/MemDBG
```

The host build runs on Linux or macOS, opens real TCP/UDP sockets, and serves the identical protocol as the console payload — useful for unit tests, frontend development, and hardware bring-up without a console.

### Desktop frontend

```sh
make frontend
open build/frontend/bin/MemDBG.app        # macOS
./build/frontend/bin/memdbg_frontend      # Linux / non-bundle builds
```

On macOS this produces a `MemDBG.app` bundle with `Resources/assets/app-icon.png` and a custom `.icns` icon. On Linux a `MemDBG.desktop` file is placed alongside the binary.

### Protocol probe CLI

```sh
./build/frontend/memdbg_probe
```

A standalone CLI for exercising a payload without the GUI.

### Full verification matrix

```sh
make clean
make verify    # host + payload-ps4 + payload-ps5
```

<br/>

## Testing

```sh
make test-aob-boundary     # 17-case AOB pattern boundary suite
make test-process-aob-e2e  # End-to-end AOB scan against a live host payload
make test                  # Both of the above
```

- **`test_aob_boundary`** mocks the memory backend and map table to verify that the scanner correctly carries pending bytes across 1 MiB chunk boundaries, handles wildcards, applies the good-suffix shift, and survives faulting pages.
- **`test_process_aob_e2e`** spawns a real `MemDBG-host` on a temporary data root and walks the full `PROCESS_LIST → PROCESS_MAPS → SCAN_PROCESS_AOB` sequence. The test is self-contained and cleans up on exit.

The frontend CMake build also produces **`memdbg_auto_search_test`**, a unit test for the Auto-Search heuristic engine.

<br/>

## Workflow

A typical MemDBG session:

1. Build and deploy the payload (`make deploy-ps5` or `make deploy-ps4`).
2. Launch the frontend (`make frontend && ./build/frontend/memdbg_frontend`).
3. In **Consoles**, enter the console IP and ports, then press **Connect**.
4. In **Processes**, refresh the list and select a target — Title ID, Content ID, and executable path are all surfaced.
5. **Memory** — read/write raw bytes; place watchpoints to detect value changes; import allocation events to track heap lifetime.
6. **Scanner** — run an exact-value scan; change the value in-game; refine (changed / unchanged / increased / decreased) until the candidate list is short. Or use **Smart Auto-Search → Health / Ammo / Resources** for a heuristic pass.
7. **AOB Scan** or **Pointer Scan** to derive stable addresses that survive ASLR across sessions.
8. **Trainer** — build a cheat entry (name, address, type, ON/OFF values, lock interval), then save as a `.cht` file or import a batchcode string.
9. **Telemetry** — watch throughput and scan-cache hit rate to catch overly aggressive read patterns.
10. **Logs** (`F10`) — scroll the live UDP feed for console-side diagnostics.

<br/>

## Configuration

The frontend writes a `frontend.conf` to the per-platform config directory:

| OS | Path |
|---|---|
| Linux | `~/.config/MemDBG/frontend.conf` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/MemDBG/frontend.conf` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\MemDBG\frontend.conf` |

```ini
host=192.168.1.100
debug_port=9020
udp_port=9023
dump_path=dumps
language=en
```

A static user guide is published via **GitHub Pages** from [`github-pages/`](github-pages) — deploy that directory as the Pages root for a full HTML/CSS walkthrough covering default ports, connection setup, scanner usage, trainer workflow, and troubleshooting.

Host build CLI flags:

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--bind=0.0.0.0` | TCP bind address. |
| `--debug-port=9020` | TCP port the frontend connects to. |
| `--udp-port=9023` | UDP port for telemetry and discovery. |
| `--data-root=/tmp/MemDBG` | Working directory for logs and dumps. |
| `--no-udp-log` | Disable UDP log delivery (discovery still responds). |
| `--no-replace-existing` | Refuse to overwrite an already-running payload instance. |

<br/>

## Release Pipeline

Every tag (`v*`) or manual `workflow_dispatch` triggers a matrix build of seven artifacts:

| Job | Artifact |
|---|---|
| `host-linux` | `MemDBG-host-linux` |
| `host-macos` | `MemDBG-host-macos` |
| `frontend-linux` | `MemDBG-frontend-linux` |
| `frontend-macos` | `MemDBG-frontend-macos.app.zip` |
| `frontend-windows` | `MemDBG-frontend-windows.zip` |
| `payload-ps4` | `MemDBG-ps4.elf` + `libmemdbg-ps4.a` |
| `payload-ps5` | `MemDBG-ps5.elf` + `libmemdbg-ps5.a` |

`make check-locales` and both scanner tests run as part of the `host-linux` job, so a release can only complete when locales are complete and all scanner tests pass. Artifacts are uploaded to the GitHub Release alongside a `SHA256SUMS.txt`.

<br/>

## Repository Status
