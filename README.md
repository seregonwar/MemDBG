MemDBG is a high-performance memory debugging suite designed for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 homebrew research. It combines a precise memory scanning engine with a remote debugging frontend, providing a unified interface for process inspection, memory analysis, and runtime debugging workflows.

Built for developers, security researchers, and advanced users who need low-level visibility into console memory — without compromising on speed or ergonomics.

> Intended for educational, research, preservation, and offline homebrew development purposes only.

<br/>

## Architecture

```
MemDBG
├── Payload Daemon          C11 — TCP wire protocol, process & memory backend
├── Core Scanner            High-performance scan engine, value comparison, filtering
├── Platform Abstraction    PS4 / PS5 backend isolation layer
├── UDP Telemetry           Diagnostic mirror → /data/MemDBG/MemDBG.log
├── Frontend UI             C++ / Dear ImGui — scanner, editor, trainer, watchlist
└── Plugin / Scripting      Planned extensibility layer
```

The payload daemon exposes process enumeration, memory map inspection, and read/write primitives over a compact TCP protocol. The frontend connects to the payload port, listens for UDP telemetry, and provides the full interactive interface.

<br/>

## Features

**Core**
- Memory read / write interface
- Remote process inspection and listing
- Memory region and map enumeration
- Hex viewer and live memory editor
- Exact-value memory scan with type selection
- Scan refinement (increased / decreased / unchanged / changed)
- Pointer and address tracking
- Session and project management

**Frontend**
- Dear ImGui — responsive, keyboard-navigable interface
- Runtime trainer list with ON / OFF capture and value lock / freeze
- Base cheat table load and save (`.cht`)
- Memory map dump for selected regions
- UDP log viewer with live telemetry feed

**Planned**
- Unknown initial value scan
- Multi-stage scan refinement pipeline
- Watchlist system
- Symbol and module viewer
- Thread information and register / context view
- Breakpoint management (where platform supports)
- Pointer scanner
- Memory region visualization
- Import / export profiles
- Plugin API and scripting support
- Automation interface
- Performance profiling tools

## Supported Platforms

| Platform       | Status              |
|:---------------|:--------------------|
| PlayStation 5  | In development      |
| PlayStation 4  | In development      |
| Windows (host) | In development      |
| Linux (host)   | In development      |
| macOS (host)   | In development      |

Platform support depends on the availability of compatible homebrew payloads and firmware-level debugging environments.

<br/>

## Building

### Prerequisites

- PS5 payload SDK at `external/ps5-payload-sdk/` (override with `PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK`)
- C11-compatible compiler for the payload target
- C++ toolchain with Dear ImGui for the frontend

### Payload — PS5

```sh
make payload-ps5
```

Override variables as needed:

```sh
make payload-ps5 PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK=/path/to/sdk PS5_HOST=192.168.1.100 PS5_PORT=9020
```

### Host Validation Build

```sh
make clean && make
./build/MemDBG-host --bind=127.0.0.1 --udp-host=127.0.0.1 --data-root=/tmp/MemDBG
```

### Frontend

```sh
make frontend
./build/frontend/MemDBG_frontend
```

<br/>

## Workflow

A typical MemDBG session:

1. Deploy the compatible debugging payload to a supported console.
2. Connect the frontend to the payload TCP endpoint.
3. Select a target process from the process list.
4. Run an exact-value scan for a known value.
5. After the value changes in-game, refine the scan.
6. Add candidate addresses to the watchlist.
7. Inspect or modify values at runtime.
8. Save the session for later analysis or sharing.

<br/>

## Configuration

A future configuration file will allow persistent settings:

```json
{
  "defaultHost": "192.168.1.100",
  "defaultPort": 9020,
  "platform": "auto",
  "scanThreads": 8,
  "sessionAutosave": true
}
```

Options are subject to change before the first stable release.
